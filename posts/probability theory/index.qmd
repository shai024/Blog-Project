### What is Probability Theory?
Probability theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the quantification of uncertainty. It is used to model the uncertainty inherent when making predictions about data. 


### What are Random Variables?
Random variables represent the set of possible outcomes of a random event. There are two types of random variables:

**Discrete Random Variables:**
Discrete random variables represent a set number of distinct values. Examples include tossing a coin (heads or tails), or rolling dice (1,2,3,4,5,6). 

**Continuous Random Variables:**
Continuous random represent an infinite number of possible values. Examples include the height of individuals, the temperature, or time. 

Each random variable is associated with a probability distribution, which describes the likelihood of the random variable taking on different values.

### Probability Distributions
A probability distribution describes how the probabilities are spread across different values of a random variable.

**Uniform Distribution:**
Assigns equal probability to all possible outcomes. This is used when we do not know the likelihood of different values.

**Normal Distribution:**
The probability density of a normal distribution (also known as the Gaussian distribution) looks like a bell-shaped curve. This curve reaches its peak at the mean and gradually decreases as values move away from the mean. Many algorithms assume that the data follows a normal distribution.

### Applications in Machine Learning
**Bayesian Inference:**
Probability theory supports Bayesian methods, where probabilities are assigned to hypotheses, and the model is updated based on observed evidence.

**Uncertainty Quantification:**
Probability theory helps quantify the uncertainty of a machine learing prediction. This can be used to analyze a model's performance. 

**Statistical Inference:**
Probability distributions and random variables are essential in hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and drawing conclusions about populations from sample data.

**Monte Carlo Methods:**
Monte Carlo techniques rely on random sampling to estimate solutions to complex problems.
